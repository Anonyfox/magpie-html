I had a bias about engineers that worked for large corporations. I assumed that they weren’t as good as indies and engineers at small companies, or else they’d actually be indies or work at small shops like Omni.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>And so I learned very quickly when I started at Audible that I was very wrong. I was impressed, and grew more impressed as time went on, by my fellow engineers’ rigor, talent, professionalism, care, and, especially, ability to work with other people toward common goals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not long after Brent joined Audible, I clearly remember him telling me that there were really smart people there who were amazing coders. And he was completely shocked by this. The look on Brent&#39;s face was just pure amazement, and he was so happy about it!</p>\n<p>I laughed and laughed at him. Of course there&#39;s talented people there! Only crazy people are willing to put up with having to file business taxes, mess with social security, find healthcare, deal with all the <em>stuff</em> you have to handle to be indie. And you don&#39;t even have to be a particularly good programmer. You just have to be persistent.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I really miss working with other folks, so I&#39;m especially happy for Brent that his exit to retirement was working with a great group of people, in a giant ass company. Everyone should experience that at least once.</p>\n<p>And now Brent is retiring! I&#39;ve known this for a while as well, because he&#39;s insanely excited and absolutely won&#39;t shut up about it (in a good way). I bet he&#39;s even counting down the number of meetings he has left at this point.</p>\n<p>Pure freedom to work on what you want, for the rest of your life. And of course he&#39;s <a href=\"https://inessential.com/2025/05/24/retirement_and_netnewswire.html\">going to be coding</a>, because Brent is a developer, and I don&#39;t think you could stop him anyway.</p>\n<p>Congrats, Brent.</p>\n",

How f&#39;n rad is that?</p>\n<p>So a little before WWDC I got a chance to fly down to Cupertino in the dead of night, to secretly adopt Acorn&#39;s UI to use the new look and feel of Apple&#39;s forthcoming Liquid Glass. NDAs were signed and I can&#39;t say much—other than it was super quick to adopt for Acorn&#39;s main canvas window. Acorn is a mostly Objective-C app&#185; with a codebase that&#39;s effectively 20 years old now, so that speaks to how relatively smooth this transition should be.</p>\n<p>I was super stoked to be able to do it, and though I&#39;m sure there will be the usual bumps along the way (especially for iOS devs), it&#39;s great to have a new UI playground to run around in.</p>\n<p>You can watch Acorn&#39;s 15 seconds on the big screen with this timestamped YouTube link: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0_DjDdfqtUE?t=3640\">Apple&#39;s WWDC 2025</a>.</p>\n<p>&#185; <span style=\"font-size: .8em;\">As John Gruber pointed out during <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vqwPUHTFEkg?t=1455s\">The Talk Show Live From WWDC 2025</a>, which you should also watch.</span></p>\n",

This replaces the dedicated &quot;Indexed PNG&quot; node, so it&#39;s all wrapped together in a single node now.</p>\n<p>There are little changes and bug fixes of course. The<a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/releasenotes.html\"> full release notes are available</a> as usual. If you already have Retrobatch 2 installed, use the Retrobatch ▸ Check for Updates… menu item to update to the latest version.</p>\n<p>One thing I did, which isn&#39;t in the release notes, is the preview canvas got a big upgrade as far as zooming, panning, and deep color support. I did a lot of refactoring when I was implementing the image diffing tools because I wanted to bring that feature to Acorn as well. So with some smart subclassing and such, I&#39;ve got a shared Metal accelerated canvas that works for both Acorn and Retrobatch. This new class is used in quite a few places in the next release of Acorn (Web Export, RAW Image preview, New View windows, etc), and obviously in Retrobatch&#39;s main preview window. It&#39;s nice having a fully built out class that can I can just drop in for standard image editing behaviors.</p>\n",

To make this possible, we&#39;re building DeltaDB: a new kind of version control that tracks every operation, not just commits.</p>\n<p>DeltaDB uses CRDTs to incrementally record and synchronize changes as they happen. Its designed to interoperate with Git, but its operation-based design supports real-time interactions that aren&#39;t supported by Git&#39;s snapshots.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That sounds pretty neat, and I&#39;m really interested to see how it goes.</p>\n<p>Zed fascinates me for some reason, and I can&#39;t quite pin down why. Is it because of the hardware accelerated text rendering? Is it because it&#39;s crazy fast? It&#39;s written in Rust? Some combo of those and other things? Beats me, but I think Zed is cool.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that Zed raised $32M in a Series B investment. I had no idea they were funded.

What if there was something in between my meek humility on this trip and the toxic rage from my youth? The paradigm shifted a little more. Why not try a little reckless egotism? It’s just a form of belief, after all, and didn’t that stranger’s bravado mirror the exact kind of belief I’d once wielded like a weapon? Maybe he had stumbled across the alchemical gold without even realizing it.</p>\n<p>“I’m about to be amazing,” a shy voice whispered in my head as I pulled off the ground and the world around me faded away, leaving just the void of a perfect crack stretching out before me into the abyss.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I love reading Goris&#39;s posts on climbing.

But your computer also runs applications, which might use a different color space. Those apps can render content, like images and videos, which might be in yet another color space. And then your monitor has its own color space, which might not even match the color space of the operating system. You could even have multiple monitors, each with different color spaces. Yep.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a pretty great writeup, and required reading for anyone who deals with color profiles and color spaces.

I&#39;ve also brought over the split view as well.</p>\n<p>When I wrote the new diff view, I knew I wanted to have it shared between the two apps, and I did a lot of work to make sure all of Acorn&#39;s main canvas features went into it as well. So things like overscroll, zooming to where the cursor pointer is, click-drag to move, shared shortcuts for zooming, deep image support, wide gamut support, etc. were all there. It was super gratifying to have that just work.</p>\n<p>And that new canvas was so nice, I ended up using it in other locations in Acorn. The RAW Import window gets the new canvas, so does the Image ▸ New View… window. I&#39;ve even added a mostly hidden new action in the Command Bar called &quot;Compare Two Front Windows&quot; which will bring up a new diff window between two images you have open.</p>\n<h4 id=\"non-destructive-linear--radial-multi-stop-gradient-filters\">Non-Destructive Linear &amp; Radial Multi-Stop Gradient Filters</h4>\n<div style=\"overflow:auto;\">\n<img src=\"https://shapeof.com/archives//2025/9/acorn82_multistop.png\" width=\"260\" style=\"float: left;\" alt=\"Acorn's multistop non-destructive gradients\" />\n\n<p>This is a feature I&#39;ve wanted for years, and while I&#39;ve always had the idea in my head how to do it, I just always kept pushing it off for some reason. At some point this past month, I think I just got tired of seeing it on the list, and finally decided to give it a proper go.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m pretty happy with how it turned out, and how performant it is.

There was a pop, myself on the ground, and a lot of pain. The end result was me moving around on crutches for a while and not a whole lot to do but sit with my ankle wrapped and elevated. (I thought I had broken it, but X-rays said otherwise. Apparently I&#39;m a bit of a wuss?)</p>\n<p>So I took the opportunity to whittle away at little things, and even add some of my own personal features.</p>\n<img src=\"https://shapeof.com/archives//2025/9/acorn82_blend_mode.png\" width=\"187\" style=\"float: right;\" alt=\"Acorn's new blend mode icons\" />\n\n<ul>\n<li>The blend mode popup now shows a little icon next to each item with a little representation of what each blend mode does. This is super informative if you have no idea what some of these blend modes will do.</li>\n<li>Smart Layer Export now has an option for shared backgrounds between exported layers.</li>\n<li>Command-Option-J is a new shortcut for duplicating the currently selected shape(s). You can also use the Quick Process menu to copy a selected shape a specific amount, but sometimes you just want to duplicate something quickly.</li>\n<li>Zoom modifiers when using the panning tool via the space bar. You can now press the space bar and then the command key to switch to the zoom tool (or use space bar + command + option to zoom out).</li>\n<li>Acorn will update its selection mode icons when you’ve pressed one of the modifier keys for adding, subtracting, or intersecting the selection (shift, option, shift+option).</li>\n<li>A new preference tab named “Mueller”. This is a little vain, but I often find myself wanting to add little tweaks just for me that I know not everyone will like. These tweaks have mostly come out of working on updates for Liquid Glass (more on that below), and I just felt like there should be a general place to do this. I know an “Appearance” tab might make more sense - but I already have ideas for other things that could go in there. <br/><br/>Who knows (besides me of course) what else might show up there eventually, and it might even go away some day. But for now it&#39;s a place where you&#39;re going to be able to change the personality of Acorn a little bit. For now there&#39;s two options: hiding the Arial font in the font picker, and changing the app icon in the Dock.</li>\n</ul>\n<center><img src=\"https://shapeof.com/archives//2025/9/acorn82_mueller_mode.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Creator Preferences\" /></center>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"file-compatibility\">File Compatibility</h4>\n<p>There’s now an option to save a flattened composite of each layer in .acorn files. This is a per image setting, and you can find it in the File ▸ File Info… window under “General”. When enabled Acorn will write a composite of your layer data into the saved .acorn file exactly as it’s rendered on canvas. This includes layer filters, masks, rasterized vectors, etc. This is super useful if you’d like to pull out full-fidelity representations of your layer data—something that’s super easy to do using SQLite:<br><code>select writefile(&#39;/tmp/&#39; || layers.name || &#39;-&#39; || layers.uti || &#39;.png&#39;, value) from layers, layer_attributes where layers.id = layer_attributes.id and layer_attributes.name = &#39;composite&#39;;</code></p>\n<p>This is not currently a global setting, since it will increase the size of your .acorn images, but using the following defaults command will turn it on by default:<br><code>defaults write com.flyingmeat.Acorn8 alwaysSaveLayerComposites 1</code></p>\n<p>Acorn’s file format is easy to grok and documented here: <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/docs/technotes/ACTN002.html\">https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/docs/technotes/ACTN002.html</a>.</p>\n<p>I really want it to be easy for other apps to read Acorn image (even Retrobatch!). And with SQLite being the basis for Acorn image files, it&#39;s incredibly easy to get that data out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"macos-26-tahoe-and-liquid-glass-support\">macOS 26 Tahoe and Liquid Glass Support</h2>\n<p>Obviously I&#39;ve been working on macOS 26 Tahoe support this summer for Acorn. While it was relatively easy to get something up and working with Liquid Glass, it&#39;s taking a bit more work to iron out all the details and work through OS bugs. Right now Acorn 8 supports macOS 14 Sonoma and later, so I&#39;m not quite ready to leave those folks behind.</p>\n<p>If the macOS 26 betas are any indication, Apple still has a lot of work left to make Tahoe amazing. I&#39;m hoping they take their time and wait until later in the fall to ship the next great version of macOS. Acorn is going to take this approach at any rate. My goal is to make Acorn feel at home in macOS Tahoe, but still retain its own personality as well.</p>\n<p>I work every day in macOS 26 right now, and Acorn 8.2 is fully supported even in the betas. All of Acorn&#39;s functionality is there, even if the UI isn&#39;t all glass all the time yet.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/\">Acorn 8.3</a> is out and the big new feature is that it supports Liquid Glass for folks who are running macOS Tahoe (which is over 50% of Acorn 8 users at this point!).</p>\n<center>\n<picture>\n  <source style=\"max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://shapeof.com/archives/2025/11/Acorn8.3.Parrot.jxl\" type=\"image/jxl\">\n  <img style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src=\"https://shapeof.com/archives/2025/11/Acorn8.3.Parrot.png\" alt=\"\">\n</picture>\n</center>\n\n<p>Actually, Acorn 8.3 came out a few weeks ago and the current release<sup><a href=\"#lgfn1\">1</a></sup> at the time of this writing is 8.3.2. I wanted to sit on an announcement a bit because I knew the refinements were going to be coming fast and I was really hoping macOS 26.1 would be released soon (it had some bugs that hurt Acorn in a number of ways). Also, you really shouldn’t be running macOS Tahoe unless you’ve updated to 26.1 (the initial release was <em>very</em> bumpy).</p>\n<p>At any rate, what’s new? Basically the UI. That’s it. The <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/releasenotes.html\">full release notes</a> are available as usual (and it includes some minor changes and bug fixes).</p>\n<p>But the UI was a ton of work! And I made it extra difficult on myself by making Liquid Glass optional. Why the heck would I do that?</p>\n<p>There were a couple of reasons (besides some people really, really not liking Liquid Glass).</p>\n<p>First of all, Acorn still supports macOS 14 and 15. And if you recall, Liquid Glass is only available on macOS 26. So any changes I’d make to Acorn would also have to work fine on previous OS releases. So in a sense, you could choose to use LG or not based on what version of macOS you’re running.</p>\n<p>But I didn’t want to completely keep folks on pre-Tahoe from joining in on the fun. So I actually broke the setting up into two different preferences.</p>\n<p>The first option in Acorn’s new Appearance settings is a checkbox for “Liquid Glass palettes”. This does the obvious thing on macOS Tahoe, and on previous versions of macOS this checkbox is disabled.</p>\n<p>The second option is “Display images edge-to-edge”. This one works on all versions of macOS that Acorn 8.3 runs on. This is the fancy look where the toolbar floats above the content as if it was a delicate and beautifully manicured piece of glass. It also removes the bottom toolbar, so there’s maximal room for your pixels to shine.</p>\n<p>I also reworked the tool palette so that it no longer takes up the whole left side of the window and instead floats above the canvas and gives more space for your image to be viewed. (And every time I look at it, it makes me think of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint\">MacPaint and its tool palette</a>. What a great app that was!)</p>\n<p>Acorn 8.3 is a free update for anyone who’s already purchased Acorn 8, and we also provide a 14 day free <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/\">trial from its website</a>. You should check it out and give it a try.</p>\n<p>So what’s next? I plan on spending the next couple of months refining Acorn 8’s UI even more. Some things are missing from the edge to edge window look, and I’d really like to see those come back. And it’s also nice seeing how other apps adopt the new UI in Tahoe, and I’m gathering inspiration from that. I’m wanting to see what the developer community coalesces around when it comes to Liquid Glass. So expect Acorn’s UI to change a bit more as time goes on.</p>\n<p><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><a name=\"lgfn1\"></a>* Acorn 8.3.2 is out for folks who have purchased it directly from our store. If you purchased via the App Store, it’s currently waiting for review and should be out shortly.</p>\n",

Gasiulis wrote a vector shape renderer named “Blaze” and made it work across multiple threads. Very cool stuff.</p>\n<p>But I was shocked when performance charts were provided, which included comparisons to rendering with Apple’s Core Graphics library. Blaze was around 20x faster at rendering than CG.</p>\n<p>This sounds like a wonderful <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/356/\">nerd snipe</a> to me.</p>\n<p>Does Core Graphics (CG) already do parallel drawing? Not that I’m aware of, at least when it comes to rendering vector shapes. What if we just … draw on multiple threads with the same <code>CGContextRef</code>? That seems like a bad idea and as far as I’m aware, <code>CGBitmapContext</code> isn’t thread-safe. And it turns out that yes - this is a bad idea. Segfaults abound.</p>\n<p>What if we make multiple CGContextRefs for each thread, but they all reference the same backing store? And what if we clip to horizontal stripes like the Blaze renderer does?</p>\n<p>Well, that seems to work just fine, and it’s a nice speed boost. A quick little test in Acorn where it rendered 28,200 shapes took about 0.93 seconds single-threaded, and only 0.11 seconds with the parallel drawing.</p>\n<p>Both are very fast for rendering that many shapes. But if we make the rendering a bit more complex by giving each of those shapes a 5pt drop shadow? Here we get 17.8 seconds for a single-thread render, and 2.7 seconds for a parallel render. Even though the multiplier is about the same (~8× speedup), 15 seconds saved is a lot.</p>\n<p>Were there any rendering glitches? There were very, very tiny anti-aliased edges that were not perceptible to the eye, and the images were otherwise identical (and I used Acorn’s “<a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/docs-8.0/command_bar.html#compare-two-front-windows\">Compare Two Front Windows</a>” command (new in 8.3!) to figure this out).\nThe implementation is very simple as well:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-objective-c\">\nCGContextRef FMCGBitmapContextCopySharingData(CGContextRef originalCTX) {\n    CGContextRef ctx =\n        CGBitmapContextCreate(CGBitmapContextGetData(originalCTX),\n        CGBitmapContextGetWidth(originalCTX),\n        CGBitmapContextGetHeight(originalCTX),\n        CGBitmapContextGetBitsPerComponent(originalCTX),\n        CGBitmapContextGetBytesPerRow(originalCTX),\n        CGBitmapContextGetColorSpace(originalCTX),\n        CGBitmapContextGetBitmapInfo(originalCTX));\n\n    return ctx;\n}\n\nvoid FMCGBitmapContextParallelDraw(CGContextRef context, void (^b)(CGContextRef chunkContext, CGRect chunkRect)) {\n\n    size_t height = CGBitmapContextGetHeight(context);\n    size_t chunkSize = 100;\n    size_t chunks = (height + chunkSize - 1) / chunkSize;\n\n    dispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH, 0);\n\n    dispatch_apply(chunks, queue, ^(size_t chunk) {\n\n        CGContextRef chunkContext = FMCGBitmapContextCopySharingData(context);\n\n        CGRect chunkRect = CGRectMake(0, chunkSize * chunk, CGBitmapContextGetWidth(chunkContext), chunkSize);\n\n        NSGraphicsContext *currentNSContext = [NSGraphicsContext graphicsContextWithCGContext:chunkContext flipped:NO];\n        [NSGraphicsContext saveGraphicsState];\n        [NSGraphicsContext setCurrentContext:currentNSContext];\n\n        CGContextSaveGState(chunkContext);\n\n        CGContextClipToRect(chunkContext, chunkRect);\n\n        b(chunkContext, chunkRect);\n\n        CGContextRestoreGState(chunkContext);\n        [NSGraphicsContext restoreGraphicsState];\n    });\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Can this be made any faster? Maybe by reusing the temporary contexts? But an 8× speed improvement is good enough for me for now. Will I use this code in production? I’m not sure yet, but I’m tempted.</p>\n",
