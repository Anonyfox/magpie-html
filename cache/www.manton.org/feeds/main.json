Sonically, it doesn’t evoke anything else. It just sounds rich and cool. Visually, with its rotating prism effect, it does evoke the classic six-color Apple logo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The new one is great. The glowing background of the old logo actually bugged me from the very beginning. Something about it felt wrong, like design that uses too many gradients getting muddled instead of crisp and clear.</p>\n",
